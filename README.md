Titanic Dataset EDA

Overview
- This repository contains an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) file (titanic.ipynb) that analyzes the Titanic dataset.
- The analysis includes loading the data, handling missing values, and deriving key insights from the dataset.

Dataset
- The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic ship, including their survival status, passenger class, name, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, fare, cabin number, and port of embarkation.

Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x and the required dependencies installed.
3. Open the EDA file (titanic.ipynb) in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

Conclusions
1. The mean age of passengers is approximately 29.7 years, with a standard deviation of 14.5 years, indicating a wide range of ages among passengers[1].
2. The survival rate is about 38.4%, showing that less than half of the passengers survived[1].
3. There is a significant correlation between fare and survival, suggesting that passengers who paid higher fares had a better chance of survival[1].
4. The majority of passengers embarked from Southampton (S), and there were more males than females on board[1].
5. Passenger class also shows a notable impact on survival, with a higher survival rate observed among first-class passengers[1].

Visualizations
The EDA file includes the following visualizations:
- Correlation matrix heatmap[1]
- Survival count, passenger class distribution, gender distribution, and embarkation point distribution plots[1]

These visualizations provide insights into the relationships between different features and their impact on passenger survival.
